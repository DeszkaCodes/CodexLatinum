# CodexLatinum

## Description
Are you a doctor, lawyer perhaps? You feel like you choose the wrong career path or you know how to read and write Latin by any chance?

Well **Codex Latinum** is just for you! Now you can enjoy programming and the beautiful language of ancient Rome.

**Codex Latinum** is a custom made programming language made in my free time.

The compiler is written in C++ (I barely use C++ so the code will probably will be unusual) and currently will only support Linux.

This project is made as a fun side-project of course and musn't be taken seriously.
