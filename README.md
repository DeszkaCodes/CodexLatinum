# CodexLatinum

## Description
Are you a doctor, lawyer perhaps? You feel like you choose the wrong career path or you know how to read and write Latin by any chance?

Well **Codex Latinum** is just for you! Now you can enjoy programming and the beautiful language of ancient Rome.

**Codex Latinum** is a custom made programming language made in my ~~mother's basement~~ free time.

This project is made as a fun side-project of course and musn't be taken seriously.
